'If you\'ve never had a problem shopping from Amazon.com, then you really are not experienced enough to be giving the \\\\\"gift\\\\\" of Amazon to someone else.  Wait until you\'ve experienced your  [25;1Hfirst screw up, and then evaluate.      I received a gift certificate, but have had trouble using it, because Amazon.com\'s outsourced customer service does not handle issues well.  They are apparentt[26;1Hly scripted to say that an appropriate person will contact you within 48 hours, but in my experience, follow up contact is not timely.  When contact is made, it has been to tell me that the issue wass[27;1H not well documented by the prior agents and to start over explaining my concern once again.  After that, I was told, once more, to wait 48 hours for follow-up that did not come.  Rinse and repeat.   [28;1H  The problem is that Amazon.com has apparently fire-walled these folks in Bangalore (or some other asian town) from the rest of the company.  Therefore, there can be no quick responses to customer cc[29;1Honcerns.  For me, after five contacts, I spoke with a \\\\\"team lead\\\\\" who indicated that prior agents had not documented the subject matter of my prior calls (even though I was promised a pomptt[30;1H resolution by those agents).    Add to all this the fact that during the recent holiday season, Amazon.com raised the price of the item I wished to purchase more than once, at the same time that thee[31;1H item\'s manufacturer was offering it for considerably less.  This makes having my \\\\\"gift\\\\\" money tied up in an Amazon.com account less than ideal.    Do not expect that the person to whom yoo[32;1Hu intend to give a gift will not have to deal with the customer service department.  Try to be forward-thinking enough to consider that a problem might occur.  If it does, the recipient will likely hh[33;1Have a very negative experience, regardless of the variety of products offered by Amazon.com.    When I asked an Amazon.com customer service agent why Amazon.com was charging 150\% of what the manufacc[34;1Hturer was selling the product for directly, Iwas told that the additional expense should be considered to cover the expert customer service available at Amazon.com.  This is terribly amusing, considee[35;1Hring that the only thing that the agents tend to do is instruct the customer to wait 48 hours for someone else to address the problem (which, in my experience, does not happen).      If you are set oo[36;1Hn letting someone choose their own gift, you should consider a pre-paid Visa or Mastercard.  That way, the recipient could use the funds at Amazon.com if he or she so chooses, and is still free to puu[37;1Hrchase something locally from a person who could not avoid responding to a customer\'s concerns.\n',REVIEWS

'I live in the UK and my family wanted to know what to get me for Christmas. I immediately thought of an Amazon gift certificate that I could use in the UK and not have to lug a bunch of Christmas prr[40;1Hesents back on the flight. I know that Amazon has a british website, but I (stupidly) assumed that I could have my orders shipped to the UK....not the case. I spent ages trying to pick out what I wann[41;1Hted only in the end to find out that NONE of my orders could be shipped to the UK. I ended up letting my mom use my account so she could use the gift certificate. Here\'s the best part: I ordered evee[42;1Hrything I wanted on the British site and one of the exact items I had in my US basket (that wouldn\'t ship to the UK) would now ship to me ....it\'s from Illinois!<br />Long story short...if you wantt[43;1H to get this as a gift for someone living outside of the US make sure it\'s the amazon site in their country!\n',REVIEWS

Well, this and the other four gift cards that were purchased by tt[19;1Hhe delightful human being that hacked my Amazon account and also stole money from my bank account on July 20th 2012.<br /><br />I hope that the purchaser really gained enjoyment from their gifts whill[20;1He I\'ve been left out of pocket by Amazon\'s awful customer service and lack of urgency in processing any refund that is due to me. The only gain I\'ve had from this, is to my email in and out boxes  [21;1H- some 15 emails have been sent to Amazon with not one single reply addressing their fault or answering my complaint. Actually...they\'ve refused to accept any complaint and advised me that there is  [22;1Hno complaint department at all.<br /><br />So there you go, a glowing review for Gift Cards that I paid for but never owned.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon - you\'re fantastic.\n',REVIEWS

She\'s not too tech savvy, shh[35;1He\'s disappointed, and I\'m upset.<br /><br /> I would have preferred a sure-fire solution from Amazon that gives me the option of having an actual physical snail-mailed card sent in light of her proo[36;1Hblem receiving the e-card -- or having the $25 paid-for the gift e-card revert to my Amazon account.

'I ordered a $1500 gift card for a friend. That was two weeks ago. The order went in quite easily but then it was flagged &#34;Not yet sent&#34; for two days. Then I found I could not even log into mm[43;1Hy account to see the order. Then I received an email telling me that Amazon could not &#34;verify my billing address&#34;. They wanted a fax number for my bank or a faxed copy of my last credit card  [44;1Hstatement. I called my bank but they would not give out a fax number or even an email address. So I faxed a credit card statement. For a day I heard nothing, so I used Live Chat to talk to an Amazon  [45;1Hperson &#34;Amina&#34;.

He transfered me to &#34;;[46;1HMalachi&#34; (in North Dakota) who couldn\'t help me either but suggested I wait a few days to see what happened.<br /><br />The next day I got an email from Amazon saying that my order had been cancc[47;1Heled but my account re-enabled. I logged in and there was literally no sign that I had ever placed an order. So I put in another order for a $1500 gift card for the friend.<br /><br />The order was ff[48;1Hlagged &#34;Not yet sent&#34; for a day or so. Then my account was disabled again, then I got an email asking me to fax my most recent credit card statement AGAIN! I did that AGAIN and this time I goo[49;1Ht an email acknowledgment. Then a day later I got an email saying someone would call me later in the day. No-one called me that day. But the next day someone did call me. I don\'t know what he said ss[50;1Hince he couldn\'t speak English but I picked out the words &#34;Amazon&#34; and &#34;gift card&#34; so I said &#34;Yes, yes, yes&#34; down the phone a lot - and guess what?
